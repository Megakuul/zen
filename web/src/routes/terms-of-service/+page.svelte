  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>

  <h2>TL;DR</h2>
  <p>
    Just don't do anything stupid. I'm offering this for free, and if you're abusing it, I simply
    won't be able to host it anymore :(
  </p>

  <h2>1. Scope and Agreement</h2>
  <p>
    These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the "zen" web application. By
    creating an account or using the service, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, you may
    not use the service.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Service Provider</h2>
  <p>
    The service is provided by the controller identified in the
    <a class="underline" href="/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Acceptable Use</h2>
  <p>
    You agree to use the service only for lawful purposes. You must <strong>not</strong>:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Use the service to send unsolicited messages (spam) or create automated accounts (bots).
    </li>
    <li>
      Attempt to bypass security measures, reverse engineer, or disrupt the service (e.g., DoS
      attacks).
    </li>
    <li>Upload content that is illegal, abusive, harassing, or violates the rights of others.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Account Termination</h2>
  <p>
    We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account at any time, without prior notice or
    liability, for any reason, including but not limited to a breach of these Terms.
  </p>
  <p>If your account is terminated, your right to use the service will cease immediately.</p>

  <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Your Content:</strong> You retain ownership of the data you upload. By uploading, you grant
      us a worldwide, royalty-free license to host and display this data strictly for the purpose of
      providing the service to you.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Disclaimer of Warranties ("As Is")</h2>
  <p>
    The service is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. We do not warrant that the
    service will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free. We disclaim all warranties, express or
    implied, to the maximum extent permitted by law.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>
    To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law (including Art. 100 of the Swiss Code of
    Obligations), we shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages,
    including loss of data, profits, or business interruption, resulting from your use of the
    service.
  </p>
  <p>Liability for damages caused by gross negligence or unlawful intent remains unaffected.</p>

  <h2>8. Governing Law and Venue</h2>
  <p>
    These Terms are governed by the laws of Switzerland. The exclusive place of jurisdiction for any
    disputes shall be the courts at the domicile of the service provider, unless mandatory statutory
    venues apply.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Changes to Terms</h2>
  <p>
    We may modify these Terms at any time. Continued use of the service after changes constitutes
    acceptance of the new Terms.
