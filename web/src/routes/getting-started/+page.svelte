  <p>
    Zen addresses a cognitive vulnerability that causes you to start random tasks shortly before the
    one you intended (e.g. you planned to write your thesis, but five minutes before starting you
    opened Instagram for two hours 😵‍💫).
    <br />
    This doesn't mean it prevents you from engaging in “non-productive” activities. If you want to scroll
    through TikTok for four hours, that's fine, just schedule it in Zen and you're good to go.
  </p>
  <p>
    It operates on <b>three</b> routine tasks that you must follow rigorously:
  </p>

  <ol class="flex flex-col gap-4 pl-4 list-decimal list-outside sm:pl-12 marker:font-bold">
    <li>
      Each morning after waking up, open the <a href="/planner" class="underline">Zen Planner</a> 🗓️
      and map out your entire day using events (similar to a standard calendar).
      <div class="p-4 my-4 rounded-xl glass text-violet-500/60">
        <b>TIP</b> If it suits you, aim to make your plan as precise and detailed as possible.
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Once planned, your day is governed by Zen. Before beginning or ending any activity, always
        open the <a href="/timer" class="underline">Zen Timer</a> ⏱️ and record it accordingly.
      </p>
      <div class="p-4 my-4 rounded-xl glass text-red-800/80">
        <b class="animate-pulse">CAUTION</b> For Zen to function correctly, establish a strict
        mental boundary that prevents you from falsifying start or stop actions. Misusing these
        (e.g. pressing start without actually starting) can create a lasting cognitive vulnerability
        that renders Zen ineffective.
        <br />
        If, for any reason, you need to depart from the plan, see <b>3.</b> but <b>NEVER</b> misuse start
        or stop!
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        For unplanned or spontaneous changes, open the <a href="/planner" class="underline"
          >Zen Planner</a
        > 🗓️ again and adjust your schedule.
      </p>
      <div class="p-4 my-4 rounded-xl glass text-red-800/80">
        <b class="animate-pulse">CAUTION</b> Zen functions only if you refrain from altering your plan
        arbitrarily without a substantial external cause!
      </div>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    By following these steps, Zen guides you through the day and provides rated feedback 📊 that
    rewards strict adherence to your plan (especially when it's precise and detailed).
    <br />
    The <a href="/leaderboard" class="underline">Zen Leaderboard</a> 🏆 compares your rating with others;
    treat it lightly - it serves mainly as a reference to measure your relative consistency.
  </p>

  <div class="p-4 my-4 rounded-xl glass text-red-800/80">
    <b class="animate-pulse">CAUTION</b> Once you begin using Zen, it's essential to comply fully
    and let it structure your entire day. Do not take this commitment lightly! If you're uncertain
    about maintaining it, <b>DO NOT USE ZEN</b>, as improper use can permanently impair your
    connection with the system.
